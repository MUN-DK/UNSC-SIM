FEATURES OF NOTE
-------------------------------
As of now we have three types of discussion style communication:
	Global Messages- General discussion for all users in the simulation
	Country Messages- General discussion for members of that country only
	Debate messages- Ambassadors of countries debate and vote on the relolution

We have implemented an activity log which can be easily viewed for the chair and moderator which logs the following:
	Simulation was created
	user has joined the simulation
	Chairperson was declared/changed
	Ambassador of a country was declared/changed
	Resolution was created
	Resolution was made active
	Country directive was added/modified
	Country has submited a position paper
	Country Ambassador has submited an amendment
	Chair has started a vote on an amendment
	Country has voted on the clause
	Voting result of the clause
	

We now have three ways to sort users into countries:
	(NEW) Manual sort - chair selects which country the user goes to.
	Instant auto sort - Sorts the users to countries automaticaly after the save button is pressed
	Auto sort on deadline date- Sorts the users to countries automatically after the registration deadline date has past.

- Chair can choose which amendment gets voted on first
- For voting, ambassadors can choose "refuse"(Not present) and this will change change the voting result
	(ie, one country chooses to refuse to vote then the outcome is out of 14 instead of 15.)
- Countries can submit an amendment for not only Edit but also Remove and Add
